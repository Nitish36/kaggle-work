Decision Tree
	Classification_DecisionTreeClassifier
	Regression=DecisionTreeRegressor
	Flow chart data process prediction
Tree Structure Pattern
	1.Root Node
	2.Decision Node
	3.Sub-tree
	4.Terminal Leaf Node


Weather	Climate	Humidity	Wind       Play
Sunny 	Hot	Normal	Strong     yes
 overcast   Cold 	High	Weak       No
Rainy        Mild


1.Root Node=split the data
2.Sub node or decision =split the data
3.Terminal or leaf=can't split the data


Entropy
	Measure of randomness of data or disorder of the data p
point 
	Measure the impurities of the data

Information Gain-To gain the information based on splitting
data points
